# pictionary

Draw and guess the concept!

## Objective

Break the ice, form team bonds within the classroom, and review terms learned previously. Students will take turns drawing a concept. Other students will try to guess that concept.

## General  
Notes | Expectations
--------|------------
Class Size | 5+
Instructors | 1+
Prep Time | 20 minutes (or 0 minutes with variation)
Activity Time | 15 - 20 minutes
Noise Level | Moderate
Beware | Students might not like the drawing part. Depending on the class, you could give them the option to speak or draw.

Variation: Do not tell the students what you will be doing or mention pictionary. Divide the students into groups of at least 2. Have each group write at least 10 concepts or terms on separate pieces of paper about what they learned or with a prompt (examples below) (post it notes, scrap pieces of paper...etc.). When they are done, have them fold each piece of paper. Switch the groups of papers so that each group has a different set of concepts from another group. Now, they will take turns drawing a concept, drawing it on the board, and having their team guess!

Possible prompts:
* Write down words or phrases related to what you think it means to be a developer.
* Write down words or phrases about technology.
* Write down words or phrases about what technology means to you.

## Preparation

Instructor should prepare the following:
* List of ~10+ terms relatively easy to act out.

## Activity

### Rules
* Drawer cannot speak or write out the word on the board

### Arrangement

1. Form groups if needed.
2. Distribute cards to each group facedown (or one by one to the drawer).

### On your Mark, Get Set, Go!   
1. The drawer attempts to draw the concept on the board to make their group guess the right answer.

### Winner!
1. If a group member shouts out the right answer, then that group gets a point. The group with the most points (or the most terms guessed correctly) wins!

### Next Round
1. The next person draws a card.
